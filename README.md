# CFtexter
For parts 4 and 5 to work, you'll need to copy the path to part 3 to the location I specified, and also compile parts 4 and 5. Please ignore the mess in part 3; I planned to add advanced features, including assembly instruction search, but never got around to it. For the same reason, I also didn't implement multithreading.
the program is written in C and Winapi, searches for calls to the standard C library and displays them on the screen, has basic user interface objects.
